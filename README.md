### Context:
This app is a apart of my final assessment in Mod 1 at Turing School. The project was assigned on a Tuesday and was due a full week later. I was able to complete it by Tuesday Morning! I worked to get my data model functioning properly before I moved to showing the data model on the DOM. This was a challenge but also a good strategy for building a strong foundation before manipulating the DOM!

### Future Features:
Given the opportunity to better this application, I would add local storage, a more creative background, a reset button to reset the wins, and multiple choices of music to choose from and listen to while you play against your friends.

### Learning Goals:
Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:

  - DRY JavaScript
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
  - Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
  - Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
  - Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challengeshoot, and plan effectively.

### Wins + Challenges:
This Project was super fun, but a big challenge! I had a couple very challenging bugs that took a very long time to fix, dealing with the turn/win/draw title on the DOM, but after a ton of time, thought, and console.logs I was able to overcome and create sound and stable logic for this ageless game.
